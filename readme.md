## Speed math challenge

A simple speed math python program to improve your speed math.
Currently in beta phase, more features to be added. Please raise issues if you find bugs or want new features/tasks.



### Known issues:
- Reciprocal test: minor float handling issue.   <code>fixed</code> 
- Final input prompt in a task keeps running after time out until an input is given.

### How to run:

- Download this repo directly or run <code>git clone https://github.com/kosmo-us/speed-math.git</code> in your terminal.
- Change to "app" directory
- Excute <code>python main.py</code> in your terminal

### Recommended python version: python3

### Implementations to come:

- Custom full challenge mode to choose which tasks to include in the full challenge mode with custom time limit.
- Store the custom challenge profiles to disk.
- Rapid mode, a short challenge mode with random tasks to complete.

### How to use this program

You can go through the complete challenge which is a compilation of all the tasks available, each task has a set period of time to complete
or practice specific tasks as well. Scores are available immediately after a task is completed or, in case of complete challenge, after the complete challenege has been completed. Date wise scores can saved to a csv file within the program directory.

**Tips to improve speed math**

- Memorize all the squares upto 30 and cubes upto 15.
- While adding, add two digits at a time instead of 1. E.g. 4843+8663, here start with 63+43 then 48+86 and so on...rest the usual addition method.
- Memorize multipliction tables upto at least 30
- Memorize exponents of 2 and 3 upto 15 and 10 respectively
- Memorize reciprocals upto 11/x for all x at least upto 12
- You can use learn some vedic math to learn short ways to do certain calculations
